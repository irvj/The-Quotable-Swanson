## The Quotable Swanson

The Quotable Swanson ([u/the-quotable-swanson](https://www.reddit.com/user/the-quotable-swanson)) is a quote-bot built for Reddit with Python and the [PRAW](https://pypi.org/project/praw/) package. This bot monitors the 'Parks and Recreation' ([r/PandR](https://www.reddit.com/r/PandR/)) subreddit, looks for comments that call it with `!Ron`, and replies with a random quote from the character [Ron Swanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Swanson).

If you'd like to help me add quotes to this bot, please submit your list of quotes as an [Issue](https://github.com/pyji/The-Quotable-Swanson/issues). Make sure your quotes are word-for-word from the show, correctly spelled and punctuated, and not already present in the [quotes.py](https://github.com/pyji/The-Quotable-Swanson/blob/master/quotes.py) list file.
