## The Quotable Swanson

The Quotable Swanson ([u/the-quotable-swanson](https://www.reddit.com/user/the-quotable-swanson)) is a quote-bot built for Reddit with Python and the [praw](https://pypi.org/project/praw/) package. This bot monitors the 'Parks and Recreation' ([r/PandR](https://www.reddit.com/r/PandR/)) subreddit, looks for comments that call it with `!wisewords`, and replies with a random quote from the character [Ron Swanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Swanson).

**The bot is currently NOT running.**
